Then go to *chrome://extensions* and turn on __Developer Mode__ in the top right corner of the page, click __Load Unpacked__ in the top left corner(still in *chrome://extensions*), and select the unzipped folder in your downloads called `sc-grade-displayer`. The extension should now be functioning.
